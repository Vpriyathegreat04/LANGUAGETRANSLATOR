 Language Translation using T5 Transformer

The Language Translation project is a natural language processing task that aims to translate text from one language to another using the T5 Transformer model. T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is a versatile model developed by Google Research that can be applied to various text-based tasks, including language translation.

The project utilizes the Hugging Face's transformers library, which provides pre-trained transformer models, tokenizers, and utilities to work with natural language processing tasks. In this specific implementation, the T5 model is used for translation.

The main steps of the project are as follows:

Load the T5 model and tokenizer: The code loads the pre-trained T5 model and its associated tokenizer from Hugging Face's model hub. The model is capable of both text generation and translation.

Input Text and Languages: The user provides an input text that they want to translate and specifies the source language (the language of the input text) and the target language (the language into which the text should be translated).

Format the Input Text: The input text is formatted as "translate [source language] to [target language]: [input text]". This format tells the T5 model to perform translation from the source language to the target language.

Translation: The formatted input text is passed to the T5 model, and the model generates the translated output.

Display the Translated Text: The translated text is then displayed as the output of the project.

The project is a simple yet effective demonstration of how powerful transformer models like T5 can be for language translation tasks
